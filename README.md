1.) IntelliScript is an IT automation tool that takes advantage of HID support found in Arduino pro micros.

2.) Tool overrides the native keyboard and can cause an oversight of a keyboard failure, check keyboard manually if workstation keyboard must be functional.

3.) If you use the BIOS hotkey function, keep the tool protected as it contains your BIOS password and should be handled as a sensitive asset.

4.) HID struggles to work on Latitude 5420/ 5410 natively.
